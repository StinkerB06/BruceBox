# BruceBox
> v1.7.0

The best thing since BeepBox and MeepMox!
## About
BeepBox is an online tool for sketching and sharing chiptune melodies. BruceBox expands the world of Beepbox into a whole new realm!
## How song sharing works
All song data is packaged into the URL at the top of your browser. When you make changes to the song, the URL is updated to reflect your changes. When you are satisfied with your song, just copy and paste the URL to save and share your song! To import a song from vanilla BeepBox, only use the hash (#) ID.
## How to use this magical thing!
### Melody
You can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. BruceBox automatically plays the notes out loud for you.
### Patterns
Notes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time. Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the different patterns you can edit. Click the other boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.
### Channels
There are four rows of patterns that BruceBox can play simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. The first three rows can play melodies and the bottom row is for drums and white noise.
### Looping
The purple loop underneath the numbered boxes controls which part of the song is currently repeating. Move the loop to listen to a different part of the song, or drag the ends to expand the loop to include the whole song.
### Keyboard shortcuts (super useful!)
When BruceBox has focus (click on its interface), you can use these keyboard shortcuts: 
Spacebar: Pause or Resume
Z: Undo
Y or Shift Z: Redo
C: Copy the current pattern
V: Paste the current pattern
[ : Move the playhead backward
] : Move the playhead forward
Arrow Keys: Change which bar is selected
1-8: Reassign a pattern to the currently selected bar
### Editing notes
In the pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration. You can also click above or below an existing note to enable a rapid arpeggio/trill effect, oscillating between 2-4 simultaneous notes.
> Cool tricky tip: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust its volume.

Neither John Nesky, BeepBox, StinkerB06, nor the MeepMox and BruceBox Dev Teams assume responsibility for any copyrighted material played in BruceBox.
